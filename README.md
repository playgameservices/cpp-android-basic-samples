Android Google Play Games Native Samples
=======================================
These samples illustrate how to use Google Play Game Services with your Android game.

* **CollectAllTheStarsNative**: Demonstrates how to use the Saved Games feature to save game data. The sample signs the user in, synchronizes their data from a named game save, and then updates the UI to reflect the saved game state.

* **minimalist**: Demonstrates a minimal use case for the Google Play Game Services API.

* **Teapots**: Demonstrates use of the Leaderboard and Achievement APIs.

Pre-requisites
--------------
1. Change the applicationId inside each individual samples build.gradle to your own package name
2. Modify res/values/ids.xml and place your IDs there, as given by the
   Developer Console (create the leaderboards and achievements necessary for
   the sample, if any). In the Developer console, select a resource type
   (Achievements, Events, Leaderboards) and click "Get Resources".  Copy the
    contents from the console and replace the contents of res/values/ids.xml.

        that matches the configuration in the Play Game developer console.

7. Run the select project. Android Studio will compile, load and start your project on your device

All projects could be built at one shot from Android Studio menu "Build" -> "Clean Project"/"Rebuild Project"
you could also build with Gradle on Terminal/Command line

Build using Gradle on OS X or Linux
-----------------------------------
1. Install Android Studio
